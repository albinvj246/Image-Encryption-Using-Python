Pixel manipulation for image encryption using Python (IDLE).

Building a simple image encryption tool with pixel manipulation might be a fascinating job! We can process images using Python and libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library).
My code applies a simple XOR encryption/decryption operation to each pixel in the image. If required, you can change both the encryption and decryption functions to use more complicated algorithms. Make sure to install PIL using pip install Pillow if you haven't already.
